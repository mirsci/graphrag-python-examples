        "# GraphRAG Python package End-to-End Example\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook contains an end-to-end worked example using the [GraphRAG Python package](https://neo4j.com/docs/neo4j-graphrag-python/current/index.html) for Neo4j. It starts with unstructured documents (in this case pdfs), and progresses through knowledge graph construction, knowledge graph retriever design, and complete GraphRAG pipelines.\n",
        "\n",
        "Research papers on Lupus are used as the data source. We design a couple of different retrievers based on different knowledge graph retrieval patterns.\n",
        "\n",
        "For more details and explanations around each of the below steps, see the [corresponding blog post](https://neo4j.com/blog/graphrag-python-package/) which contains a full write-up, in-depth comparison of the retrieval patterns, and additional learning resources.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Pre-Requisites\n",
        "\n",
        "1. __Create a Neo4j Database__: To work through this RAG example, you need a database for storing and retrieving data. There are many options for this. You can quickly start a free Neo4j Graph Database using [Neo4j AuraDB](https://neo4j.com/product/auradb/?ref=neo4j-home-hero). You can use __AuraDB Free__ or start an __AuraDB Professional (Pro) free trial__ for higher ingestion and retrieval performance. The Pro instances have a bit more RAM; we recommend them for the best user experience.\n",
        "2. __Obtain an OpenAI Key__: This example requires an OpenAI API key to use language models and embedders. The cost should be very minimal. If you do not yet have an OpenAI API key you can [create an OpenAI account](https://platform.openai.com/signup) or [sign in](https://platform.openai.com/login). Next, navigate to the [API key page](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) and click \"Create new secret key\". Optionally naming the key.\n",
        "3. __Fill in Credentials__: Either by copying the [`.env.template`](.env.template) file, naming it `.env`, and filling in the appropriate credentials, or by manually putting the credentials into the second code cell below. You will need:\n",
        "    1. The Neo4j URI, username, and password variables from when you created the database. If you created your database on AuraDB, they are in the file you downloaded.\n",
        "    2. Your OpenAI API key.\n",
